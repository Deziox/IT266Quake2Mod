# Quake II Mod

# STORY:
You found some bizarre creatures when you woke up on an alien planet. <br />
They wanna help you escape, but their friends (who are apparently zombies) are trying to kill you.<br />
You gotta fight your way through the zombies, using your alien friends, as bullets. I guess.<br />

# THE MOD: Pikmin Battle Game Mechanics. (Deliverables):
1) **The player starts with 8 pikmin. The Pikmin that the player owns follows the player around. The player can shoot these pikmin. (This is done with a circular array pointer system, using the 0 index as the pointer to the array of pikmin, and when a pikmin is shot it puts that pikmin at the end of the list and shifts the rest down one).**
2) **The enemy soldiers start with 6-10 pikmin. These enemies can shoot pikmin at you too.**
3) **If the player or an enemy gets hit with a pikmin they lose a pikmin. If the player loses all of their pikmin the player dies, if the enemy dies from the player, the enemy becomes the player's pikmin.**
4) **Pikmin have different effects:**<br />
   a) Ice Pikmin - Freezes the enemy for 8 seconds (even the player if they get hit)<br />
   b) Gravity Pikmin - A pikmin that slowly floats in the air and takes a pikmin if collided with, so a movement trap <br />
   c) Speed Pikmin - A pikmin that is shot fast and bounces around like a ball. (Movement type bounce like a grenade) <br />
   d) Bomb Pikmin - Pikmin that Explodes on impact, taking one pikmin from all enemies hit in a radius. <br />
   e) Poison Pikmin - Upon collision, the enemy will lose one pikmin every 3 seconds. (lasts for 12 seconds) <br />
   f) Regular Pikmin - Just a regular pikmin. <br/>
6) **Pikmin powerup items**<br />
   a) Item to stock up +50 pikmin<br />
   b) Item to stock up +10 pikmin<br />
   c) Item to stock up +1 pikmin<br />
   d) Item to Set pikmin damage to double<br />
   e) Item to Set your pikmin throw speed to double,<br/>
7) **Hud shows Amount of Pikmin instead of health. It also shows the type of pikmin up next in your throwing hands. Also shows if you are frozen or poisoned.**<br />

# Installation Instructions and notes: 
- Unrar the compressed "Coronavirus.rar" and put the coronavirus folder in quake II main directory in steam commonapps.
- Use the shortcut in "coronavirus" to open up Quake II with the mod.
- yes I realize naming the folder coronavirus is kind of sketchy. but I promise its not a virus.

# TL;DR<br />
Starting with 8 pikmin, you throw them at enemies and they can throw theirs at you.<br />
The pikmin have respective abilities. If you get hit you lose a pikmin, lose all your pikmin and you die.<br />
